# Without Dream, What's the Difference between Men And Salted Fish


Hello friend! I am Jason, a.k.a. `Ja5on` and welcome to my site.  
A little about me, I am currently a cyber consultant specializing in red teaming (Windows AD) and penetration testing. My personal interest is to follow researches / techniques shared by the community and create guides and tools around them.  
I used to play CTF in my university life and after a lots of things happened, I am now back to the CTF world too! Recently joint the (best) HK CTF team [Black Bauhinia](https://b6a.black/).

This site is setup to share my ideas, research, tools, or anything else I want to share. I hope you can find something interesting here and feel free to reach out anytime with questions or feedback!
